Hacktoberfest 2022 is finally here, and we're pretty excited about it. We think it's a great time to encourage, recognise and reward developers in the community who dedicate their time to creating for others.

Hacktoberfest is an annual festival hosted by DigitalOcean that takes place in the month of October to celebrate the open source community. As part of this 31-day celebration, contributors and open source maintainers are encouraged to work on open source projects and win swag to mark the occasion.

#### Tips for Contributors:

- PRs beyond our open issues are welcome but make sure your contributions are meaningful and beneficial to other users otherwise your PR may be closed and marked as â€˜invalidâ€™.
- Issues before PRs. If you plan to make a contribution, please make sure there is an issue for it. You can either find an existing issue or open a new issue if none exists.


### If you are willing to contribute, please check the guide to local system setup given below.

Don't forget to check the [issue](https://github.com/akebu6/Kotlin-Code/issues/20) section where we have already raised some issues for you to work on.

# How to Contribute :-
Follow the steps below :-

# Git Setup Guide
## To initialise Git, write
```bash
git init
```

## 1. Configure your local Git
```bash
git config --global user.name "github username"
```

```bash
git config --global user.email "email address"
```

## 2.  Go to the first-contribution repository and Fork it.
* A fork is a rough copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely test and debug with changes without affecting the original project. One of the excessive use of forking is to propose changes for bug fixing.


* Click on Code Button and copy the URL of your forked Repository


## 3. Switch to your Git bash window, and enter the following :

* Clone the Forked project on your local system 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akebu6/Kotlin-Code.git
```


* Make the changes

Open contributors.js in your favourite text editor and add a new object below the existing objects in the format given below.


## 4. Creating a Pull request
### Create a branch

* A branch is designed to encapsulate a group of changes. These changes might be thrown away, entirely rewritten or in the majority of cases theyâ€™ll be promoted into the main history of the codebase - via a merge.


* Creating a branch

```bash
git branch branch_name
```

* Checkout to the created branch

```bash
git checkout branch_name
```


* Now add the files using the git command

```bash
git add .
```
* Commit the changes to the local project

```bash
git commit -m "Added code"
```

* Push the changes to your forked github repo
```bash
git push origin branch_name
```

## 5. Final Steps
* Open your forked git repository, you will get a message like as shown in the figure (if not then refresh the page).

* Click on "Contribute"


*  Now click on "Open pull request"



*  Click on "Create pull request"

 * You may add a Comment to your Pull Request


### You will get message which means that you have sucessfully made a pull request !
