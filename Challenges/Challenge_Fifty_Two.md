The function pepTalk takes the space travelerâ€™s name in the input (two words separated by a space) and returns a string with their name and last-minute advice. If the name has an incorrect format, an exception may occur in pepTalk.

Fix the code below: correct the call of the function by wrapping it in the try-catch-finally expression.

If all goes well, the variable advice should be equal to the string that is the result of the execution of pepTalk.

If an exception occurs when calling the function, advice should contain the message Don't lose the towel, nameless one..

In the final block, write the code that will print Good luck!.
