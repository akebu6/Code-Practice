QUESTION:
All the letters of the English alphabet are divided into vowels and consonants.
The vowels are: a, e, i, o, u, y.
The remaining letters are consonants.

A word is considered euphonious if it doesn't have three or more vowels or consonants in a row. Otherwise, it is considered discordant.

Your task is to create euphonious words from the discordant ones. You can insert any letters inside the word. Output the minimum number of characters needed to create a euphonious word from a given word.

For example, the word "schedule" is considered discordant because it has three consonants in a row: "sch". To create a euphonious word you need to add any vowel between 's' and 'c' or between 'c' and 'h'.
