There is an integer as input. Output True if its value is within the interval
(−15,12]∪(14,17)∪[19,+∞), otherwise print False (case sensitive).

Please note the different brackets, which are used to specify intervals. The problem uses semi-open and open intervals. You can read more about them in the Wikipedia.

The union sign means a union of intervals. A shortlist of intervals:

| Union | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- |
| (a, b) | a < x < b |
| (a, b] | a < x <= b |
| [a, b) | a <= x < b |
| [a, b] | a <= x <= b |
