* QUESTION:
* The password is hard to crack if it contains at least A uppercase letters, at least B lowercase letters, at least C digits, and includes exactly N symbols. Also, a password cannot contain two or more same characters coming one after another. For a given numbers A, B, C, N you should output a password that matches these requirements.
*
* It is guaranteed A, B, C, and N are non-negative integers and A + B + C <= N. Keep in mind, that any parameter can be equal to zero. It means that it's ok if the password doesn't contain symbols of such type.
